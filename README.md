# Final Project Peer Review
After multiple final project topic switches, I think I have finally settled on one: a GPA calculator app!

## About the GPA calculator
My goal for this project is to create a fully functioning GPA calculator application that allows users to calculate their GPA based on their course grades and credit hours. 

### Intended Features
- User login
- Input course details (course name, grades, credit hours)
- Calculate GPA based on input data
- Store course information in MySQL database

### Current Features
- Index and About page
- User input fields
- Course table outline

So far I have only created the outline for what the final web app will look like. I have taken design inspiration from the lecture videos by Morgan Worrell and this full stack tutorial by Nsquared Coding https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrj9AohVhPA
