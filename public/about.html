            <p>Hi, I'm Ashly! I'm currently working towards a BS in Information Technology at Regis University.</p>
            <br><br>

            <h3>About this project</h3><br>
            <p>Originally, my plan was to create a recipe app, but I realized it was out of scope.
                Instead, I have decided to create a to-do list app that displays tasks and the time they were created.
                It will also have the ability to complete/delete tasks. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p> As I continue to grow more comfortable with web development, I'm confident that I will revist 
                and develop a recipe app in the future.</p>
