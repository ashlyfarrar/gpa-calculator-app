            <h3>About me</h3><br>
            <p>Hi, I'm Ashly! I'm currently working towards a BS in Information Technology at Regis University.</p>
            <br><br>

            <h3>About this project</h3><br>
            <p>Originally my plan was to create a recipe app, but I realized it was out of scope.
                Instead, I have decided to create a GPA calculator app that implements a mySQL database.
                Users will have the ability to add courses, credit hours, and grades. The app will then calculate
                the GPA. Users will also have the ability to edit or remove courses from the list. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p> As I continue to grow more comfortable with web development, I'm confident that I will revisit 
                and develop a recipe app in the future.</p>
